## Originality
To our best knowledge, we are the first to propose a new Anti-UAV task, corresponding datasets, evaluation metrics and baseline methods, with both PyTorch and Jittor support ([Jittor Official News](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SxeWERbJVcnBCCFmpKsAxQ), [BSIG Official News](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HbSgLK5Kw89cOMjsQZSjXA)).

## Task Definition
Anti-UAV refers to discovering, detecting, recognizing, and tracking Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) targets in the wild and simultaneously estimate the tracking states of the targets given RGB and/or Thermal Infrared (IR) videos. When the target disappears, an invisible mark of the target needs to be given. A lot of higher-level applications can be founded upon anti-UAV, such as security of important area, defense against UAV attack, and automated continuous protection from potential threat caused by UAV instrusion.

****


## Motivation
- The Anti-UAV project of Institute of North Electronic Equipment, Beijing, China is proposed to push the frontiers of discovery, detection and tracking of UAVs in the wild.


- Recently, UAV is growing rapidly in a wide range of consumer communications and networks with their autonomy, flexibility, and a broad range of application domains. UAV applications offer possible civil and public domain applications in which single or multiple UAVs may be used. At the same time, we also need to be aware of the potential threat to airspace safty caused by UAV intrusion. Earlier this year, multiple instances of drone sightings halted air traffic at airports, leading to significant economic losses for airlines.


- Currently, in computer vision community, there is no high-quality benchmark for anti-UAV captured in real-world dynamic scenarios. To mitigate this gap, this project presents a new dataset, evaluation metric, and baseline method for the area of discovering, detecting, recognizing, and tracking UAVs. The dataset consists of high quality, Full HD video sequences (both RGB and IR), spanning multiple occurrences of multi-scale UAVs, densely annotated with bounding boxes, attributes, and flags indicating whether the target exists or not in each frame.

****
## Environment Setup
Refer to: [3rd_Anti-UAV_CVPR2023](https://modelscope.cn/models/iic/3rd_Anti-UAV_CVPR23/summary).

Note:

* We recommend that you use `python == 3.8`, or conflicts may occur;
* For those using NVIDIA RTX 30 & 40 series GPUs, the cuda version 11.8 has been tested successfully;
* When you run the command `pip install -r requirements/cv.txt`, there might be some problems, like unable to find bmt_clipit, clip, panopticapi, videofeatures_clipit. And these errors can be ignored;
* You need to install jibjpeg4py library and `jittor == 1.3.8.5`.

## Data Preparation

Currently, we offer three public datasets for the Anti-UAV task.

</div>


- Scenario Variations: Compared to the previous challenge, we further enlarge the dataset this year by adding more challenging video sequences with dynamic backgrounds, complex movements, and tiny-scale targets, such that the resulting new dataset covers a greater variety of scenarios with multi-scale UAVs. Examples are shown as follows.

* Please note that 410 and 600 versions only contain IR videos while 300 version contains both RGB videos and IR videos. In this release, the model is capable of dealing with both RGB data and IR data, so we recommend that you use the 300 version dataset.

- Please refer to our [Anti-UAV v1 paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9615243) and [Anti-UAV v3 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15767.pdf) for more details ([WeChat News](https://zhaoj9014.github.io/pub/Anti-UAV.pdf)).

## Evaluation Metrics
We define the tracking accuracy as:
<img src="https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/Anti-UAV/blob/master/Fig/3.png" width="1000px"/>
For frame t, IoU_t is Intersection over Union (IoU) between the predicted tracking box and its corresponding ground-truth box, p_t is the predicted visibility flag, it equals 1 when the predicted box is empty and 0 otherwise. The v_t is the ground-truth visibility flag of the target, the indicator function Î´(v_t>0) equals 1 when v_t > 0 and 0 otherwise. The accuracy is averaged over all frames in a sequence, T indicates total frames and T^* denotes the number of frames corresponding to the presence of the target in the ground-truth.

## Training and Inference
- Training

Currently, we have some problems with training in [Jittor](https://cg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jittor/), but you can still try to run the commands as follows:
```bash
cd {PROJECT_ROOT}/anti_uav_jittor
python ltr/run_training.py modal modal
```

Or you can train the model with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).

Also, if you have any suggestions on how to do it, feel free to open an issue!

- Inference

In the root path of the project, run the command `python pysot_toolkit/test.py`

## Notebooks
We provide a demo notebook in [`anti_uav_jittor/demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/Anti-UAV/blob/master/anti_uav_jittor/demo.ipynb) that can help developers better understand the workflow of this demo.

## FAQs

We will keep updating this section, so feel free to open an issue.
<details>
<summary>1. Q: When I run the training command, there is an error indicating that setting an array element with a sequence, the requested array has an inhomogeneous shape.</summary>
A: In AntiFusion.py, set `visible_data = np.array, dtype = object`.
